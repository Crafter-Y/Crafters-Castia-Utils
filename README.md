# Crafters Castia Utils

This mod contains some tweaks and addons I coded mainly for myself. But feel free to check it out.

## Disclaimer

This mod is in early development and UNFINISHED. Bugs/crashes are expected.

## Download

For now, there will be no download available, as this is in a very early stage. At some point I will upload a file on GitHub. I don't think I will put this on Curseforge/Modrinth.

## API access

This mod utilises data from my [api](https://github.com/Crafter-Y/castia-utils-api). But certain features are not enabled for the public token.

Feel free to host it yourself or ask me for a token ingame or on Discord (@crafter_y).

The public api key is: "public" and should already be set as the default value.
