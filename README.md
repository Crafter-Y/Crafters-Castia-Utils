# Crafters Castia Utils

This mod contains some tweaks and addons I coded mainly for myself. But feel free to check it out.

## Disclaimer

This mod is in early development and UNFINISHED. Bugs/crashes are expected.

## Download

For now, there will be no download available, as this is in a very early stage. At some point I will upload a file on GitHub. I don't think I will put this on Curseforge/Modrinth.

## API access

This mod can utilise data from my [api](https://github.com/Crafter-Y/castia-utils-api), but a token is needed for now. Maybe I will open this API up to the public or something like that, but for now it is like it is.

If you want a token to play around, I might provide you one if you message me ingame or on Discord (@crafter_y)

## Features

- Chat Adblock (Configurable categories, e.g. showcase, vote, tips, store advertisements)
- ChestShop Data Collection (Stores every chestshop in a database)
- Useful Tooltip Data (displays the stack/buy/sell price of every item in its item tag) (some parts require API)
- Auction house price tracking (requires API)
- [Chest Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-tracker) Integration

Planned features:

- PV Chesttracker integration
- buy/sell REI integration
- Web frontend to view itemprices and money gathering opportunities
- Personal chat history (see what someone said in the past)
- Personal money history (see your money history and other's as well)
- fallen town logs

## Modpacks

Please do not include this in any modpack. Sure, try it out, but it is too buggy to be widely used.
